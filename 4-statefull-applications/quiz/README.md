# Questions

## 1. What is Helm in Kubernetes?
1) A Kubernetes object used to define the networking configuration for a pod
2) A YAML file used to create a Kubernetes deployment
3) A package manager for Kubernetes applications
4) A type of Kubernetes probe used for checking application health

## 2. What are some benefits of using Helm in Kubernetes?
1) Simplifies application deployment and management
2) Enables version control and rollbacks
3) Facilitates collaboration and sharing of application templates
4) All of the above

## 3. What is an Ingress in Kubernetes?
1) A type of Kubernetes object used to define the networking configuration for a pod
2) A YAML file used to create a Kubernetes deployment
3) A Kubernetes object used to manage external access to a cluster
4) A type of Kubernetes probe used for checking application health

## 4. What is the purpose of an Ingress controller in Kubernetes?
1) To manage and route external traffic to the correct Ingress resource
2) To manage and deploy Kubernetes applications
3) To define the networking configuration for a pod
4) To create Kubernetes deployments from YAML files

## 5. What are some advantages of using an Ingress in Kubernetes?
1) Simplifies external access to Kubernetes services
2) Allows for routing of traffic based on path, host, or header values
3) Supports SSL/TLS encryption and termination
4) All of the above

## 6. How do you define routing rules for an Ingress in Kubernetes?
1) Using annotations in the Ingress YAML file
2) Using environment variables in the pod definition
3) Using Labels and Selectors in the pod definition
4) Using the kubectl CLI to modify the Ingress resource

## 7. What is a Helm chart in Kubernetes?
1) A YAML file used to create a Kubernetes deployment
2) A package containing all the resources necessary to create a Kubernetes application
3) A type of Kubernetes object used to define the networking configuration for a pod
4) A type of Kubernetes probe used for checking application health

## 8. How do you install a Helm chart in Kubernetes?
1) Using the kubectl CLI to create the necessary Kubernetes objects
2) Running the helm install command with the chart and configuration values
3) Editing the YAML file of the chart and applying it using kubectl
4) Using the Kubernetes Dashboard to upload and install the chart

## 9. What is a values.yaml file in a Helm chart?
1) A YAML file used to create a Kubernetes deployment
2) A file containing configuration values for a Helm chart
3) A type of Kubernetes object used to manage external access to a cluster
4) A type of Kubernetes probe used for checking application health

## 10. What is the difference between a Helm chart and a Kubernetes YAML file?
1) A Helm chart is used for deploying applications, while a Kubernetes YAML file is used for configuring the cluster
2) A Helm chart is a package manager for Kubernetes resources, while a Kubernetes YAML file describes the desired state of a resource
3) A Helm chart is a YAML file that includes additional templates and metadata, while a Kubernetes YAML file only describes the resource's properties
4) A Helm chart is used for managing cluster resources, while a Kubernetes YAML file is used for managing container images
