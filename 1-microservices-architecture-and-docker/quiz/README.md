# Questions

## 1. Which of the following best describes Microservices?
1) A monolithic application architecture that consists of multiple services.
2) A distributed application architecture where each service is loosely coupled and performs a specific task.
3) An architecture where each service communicates with the database directly.
4) An architecture where services are not containerized.

## 2. What is Docker?
1) A containerization platform that allows developers to package, deploy, and run applications in a container.
2) A virtual machine platform that allows developers to create virtual machines on their local computer.
3) A database management system that allows developers to store and retrieve data efficiently.
4) An operating system that allows developers to manage hardware resources.

## 3. What is Dockerfile used for?
1) To define the runtime environment for a container.
2) To define the configuration of the Docker daemon.
3) To define the instructions for building a Docker image.
4) To define the configuration of the container networking.

## 4. Which of the following is an advantage of using Docker?
1) Containers are faster than virtual machines.
2) Containers can run on any operating system.
3) Containers are more secure than virtual machines.
4) Containers require more hardware resources than virtual machines.

## 5. What is Union File System in Docker?
1) A file system that combines multiple file systems into a single view.
2) A file system that allows Docker containers to share files.
3) A file system that allows Docker containers to communicate with each other.
4) A file system that allows Docker containers to access the host system's file system.

## 6. What is Docker Compose?
1) A tool for deploying containers on a cluster of machines.
2) A tool for managing Docker images.
3) A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
4) A tool for managing container networking.


## 7. Which of the following is an advantage of containerization?
1) Containers can run on any hardware platform.
2) Containers require less hardware resources than virtual machines.
3) Containers are easier to manage than virtual machines.
4) Containers provide better security than virtual machines.

## 8. What is the difference between a Docker container and a Docker image?
1) A Docker container is a running instance of a Docker image.
2) A Docker image is a snapshot of a Docker container.
3) A Docker container is a lightweight virtual machine.
4) A Docker image is a collection of source code.


## 9. What is containerization?
1) The process of creating a virtual machine on a physical server.
2) The process of running multiple applications on a single server.
3) The process of packaging an application and its dependencies into a container.
4) The process of securing a network by isolating different applications.

## 10. Which of the following is an example of a tool that can be used to manage a Docker swarm?
1) Docker Machine
2) Docker Hub
3) Docker Swarm Mode
4) Docker Compose

## 11. Which of the following is NOT a benefit of using microservices?
1) Increased flexibility and agility
2) Improved fault isolation and resilience
3) Reduced complexity and maintenance costs
4) Improved performance due to reduced network overhead
